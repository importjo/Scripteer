# 2. Change to Cucumber

Date: 2018-12-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

With the discovery of Cucumber for BDD, i wanted to add this feature in the project to test
BDD programming. The original project gogo was already started in a blank Maven project with
jdk 9 and junit 5 not fully compatible with Cucumber.

## Decision

I have created a new git repository name Scripteer and created a new Maven project from Cucumber archetype.
Already created files will be copied into this project.

## Consequences

Further work in Scripteer are now done in BDD.
